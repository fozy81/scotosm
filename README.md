Scotland OSM mining for bicycle data:

rcode - this code run in r. Brings back all a table of stats and maps showing NCN cycle routes in Scotland.
index - index html file for maps and stats table.
boundaries - simplified polyline MSP boundaries used by r script to 'cookie cut' areas to create stats for each constituency.


That's about it for the moment.
