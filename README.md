Scotland OSM mining for bicycle data:

Rcode, this code runs in R. Brings back a table of stats and maps showing NCN cycle routes in Scotland. 
You will need to point it to  boundary files saved locally and install libraries into R.

Index, index html file for maps and stats table.

Boundaries folder, simplified polyline MSP boundaries used by r script to 'cookie cut' areas to create stats for each constituency.


That's about it for the moment.
